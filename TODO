## Code

  * Streamline spells structure with InstanceMethods and ClassMethods autohooks.
    Only InstanceMethods definitions are extended with Metamorphosis::RedefInit.

  * In plugins definition, get rid of the base namespace (receiver).

  * "CamelCased", "Under_scored", :symbol and "Capitalized string with spaces"
    activate support.

  * Add support for a default configuration file, using Configliere.
    The configuration file will be at ./.metamorphosis/config.yml.
    Config keywords: :only, :only_within, :except, :namespace
    And validations on those settings when loading (Configliere does that!)
  
  * Allow to override the default "Spells" convention (to "Plugins" for instance :))
    It should create the appropriate dynamic methods, for instance
    receiver.spells -> receiver.plugins (but keep the original alias too).

  * Propagate the config object to the receiver. Or maybe even the instance
    methods of the Config module so it has full control over the plugin conf?
    Not really useful though, just for the sake of reflection.

  * Have the unpack method really bypass the default extending/merging behavior.

  * Create self.load, called by self.extended, and move behavior from the latter
    to the former so as to gain some modularity (we may want to reload… one day).

  -------------------------- someday… -------------------------------

  * Add support for several plugins namespaces under spells/
      ./spells/mybase1/
      ./spells/mybase2/
      where mybase1 and mybase2 have extended Metamorphosis and are using it
      on their proper namespaces (may be the default value, or a similar
      custom value, or two different values).
      
      If mybase is actually a complex constant, say Project::Public::API::FooBar,
      the path is ./spells/project-public-api-foobar/

      Specific configuration for mybase is stored at ./.metamorphosis/mybase.yml.
      The config loader will load any *.yml file under ./.metamorphosis/ and
      try to parse it as a valid config file. It will raise a LoadError if it fails
      to do so (Configliere does not that by default, it "loads" an empty config).

      If the namespace has been changed to a custom value (say "plugins")
      in ./.metamorphosis/config.yml, then the path is
      ./plugins/mybase/

  * Add support for (un)extending on the fly (using a BlankSlate layer?).
