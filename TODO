## Code

  * Streamline plugins structure with InstanceMethods and ClassMethods autohooks.
    Only InstanceMethods definitions are extended with Metamorphosis::RedefInit.

  * In plugins definition, get rid of the base namespace (receiver).
  
  * Allow to override the default "spells" convention ("plugins" for instance :))
    It should create the appropriate dynamic methods, for instance
    receiver.spells -> receiver.plugins (but keep the original alias too).

  * Have the unpack method really bypassing the default extending convention.

  * Create self.load, called by self.extended, and move behavior from the latter
    to the former so as to gain some modularity (we may want to reloadâ€¦ one day).

  * Add support for a configuration file, using Configliere.
    The configuration file will be ./.metamorphosis/config.yml.
    config keywords: :only, :only_within, :except, :namespace
    And validations on thoses settings when loading (Configliere does that!)

  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  * Add support for several plugins namespaces under spells/
      ./spells/mybase1/
      ./spells/mybase2/
      where mybase1 and mybase2 have extended Metamorphosis and are using it
      on their proper namespaces (may be the default value, or a similar
      custom value, or two different values).
      
      If mybase is actually a complex constant, say Project::Public::API::FooBar,
      the path is ./spells/project-public-api-foobar/

      Specific configuration for mybase is stored at ./.metamorphosis/mybase.yml.
      The config loader will load any *.yml file under ./.metamorphosis/ and
      try to parse it as a valid config file. It will raise a LoadError if it fails
      to do so (Configliere does not that by default, it "loads" an empty config).

      If the namespace has been changed to a custom value (say "plugins")
      in ./.metamorphosis/config.yml, then the path is
      ./plugins/mybase/

  * Someday, add support for (un)extending on the fly (using a BlankSlate layer?).

## Documentation

  * Switch from RDoc to YARD (rdoc.info).
