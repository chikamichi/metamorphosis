## Code

* Streamline plugins structure with InstanceMethods and ClassMethods autohooks.
  Only InstanceMethods definitions are extended within RedefInit.
* In plugins definition, get rid of the base namespace.
* Add support for a configuration file, using Configliere.
  The configuration file will be named .spells.yml.
  config keywords: :only, :only_within, :except, :namespace
* Add support for several plugins namespaces under spells/:
    spells/base1/...
    spells/base2/...
    where base1 and base2 have extended Metamorphosis somehow.
    The config file should then handle an argument to the config method, the
    name of a base.
* Allow to override the default "spells" convention ("plugin" for instance :)
* Have the unpack method really bypassing the default extending convention.
* Someday, add support for (un)extending on the fly (using a BlankSlate layer?).

## Documentation

* switch from RDoc to YARD (rdoc.info)
