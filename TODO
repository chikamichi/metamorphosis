## Code

* Streamline plugins structure with InstanceMethods and ClassMethods autohooks.
  Only InstanceMethods definitions are extended within PlugInit.
* Sreamline the vocabulary (for instance, rename PlugInit to something cooler).
* In plugins definition, get rid of the base namespace.
* Add support for a configuration file, merely a block:
  * config do ... end
  * config "A::Specific::Base" do ... end
  The configuration file will reside under circe/ as config.rb and will be evaled
  in Metamorphosis#self.extended.
  config keywords: :only, :only_within, :except
* Add support for several plugins namespaces under circe/:
    circe/base1/...
    circe/base2/...
    where base1 and base2 have extended Metamorphosis somehow.
    The config file should then handle an argument to the config method, the
    name of a base.
* Have the unpack method really bypassing the default extending convention.
* Someday, add support for (un)extending on the fly (BlankSlate layer?).

## Documentation
