# Metamorphosis. Let's do some differentiation!
# 
# Metamorphosis is a generic plugins system. Using Metamorphosis,
# a module or a class is able to alter and/or extend its original
# nature.
#
#
# It means the module or class will be able to activate plugins
# which have been written on the purpose of adding new or redefining
# existing behaviors.
#
# Plugins can alter class or instance methods, within modules or classes.
# A convention in plugins definitions makes it possible to auto-discover
# which modules or classes of the receiver are concerned by the plugin
# to be activated. Those modules or classes will gain some new behavior
# if the plugin declares so, while retaining the ability to fallback on
# their original behavior via simple inheritance. Pluginable will also
# automagically hook class and instance methods in their proper location
# if a simple structure convention is followed in the plugin definition.
#
# TODO
# The hooking process can be configured (no more automagical hooking)
# using the unpack method each plugin may provide:
#   def unpack
#     # ... design pending
#   end
#
# If several plugins are activated and performs some redefinitions
# in a class or module of the receiver, one has to pay extra attention
# to chained behavior and inconsistency. It's good practice to always
# call super at some point so as to traverse the all plugins inheritance
# chain until the original definition is reached.
#
# If you want to completely overwrite the original behavior while being
# able to activate multiple plugins, a nice way to go is to write a
# SuperPlugin which redefines the method you're targeting at, without
# calling super. Activate this SuperPlugin first, then activate the other
# plugins, using super in their redefinitions so as to reach the SuperPlugin
# implementation in the end.
#
# TODO
# If you want to bold-skip a plugin once, you may first check wether
# it's activated using MyProject.plugins. If so, you may then call
# <code>MyProject.bypass :plugin_name</code>, which will perform
# <code>shutdown</code> and <code>activate</code> in sequence while
# retaining the inheritance position of the bypassed plugin.
